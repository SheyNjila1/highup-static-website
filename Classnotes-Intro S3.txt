1. Experience sharing on AWS journey so far
	- Identity and Access Management OK
	- Networking    OK
	- Compute	OK 
	- Storage
	- RDS (Databases)----> sql and nosql (dynamoDB) 
Linux commands, AWS CLI, CDK (automation) 
2. General overview of AWS Services
3. Short Overview on Compute
4. AWS storage (EBS, EFS, FXs, S3, RDS)
	Block Storage ====> Elastic Block Storage(EBS) ==>Persistent
	File System  ====> EFS (Linux), FXs(Windows)
	Databases [RDS] ===> Oracle, MariaDB, Mysql, Postgres, etc
	Object Storage =====> Simple Storage Service (S3) 
	
5. Introduction to S3
	- What is S3 
Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is -
- an object storage service 
- that offers industry-leading
	- scalability, 
	- data availability, 
	- security, and 
	- performance.

What are the different S3 storage classes:
1. S3 Standard for frequently accessed data 
	- Low latency and high throughput performance
	- Designed for durability of 99.999999999% of objects across multiple Availability Zones
	- Designed for 99.99% availability over a given year

2. Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)
	- Same low latency and high throughput performance of S3 Standard
	- Designed for durability of 99.999999999% of objects across multiple Availability Zones
	- Designed for 99.9% availability over a given year

3. Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering (S3 Intelligent-Tiering)
	- The Infrequent Access tier saves up to 40% on storage costs
	- The Archive Instant Access tier saves up to 68% on storage costs
	- Deep Archive Access tier has the same performance as Glacier Deep Archive and saves up to 95% for rarely accessed object
	- Designed for durability of 99.999999999% of objects across multiple Availability Zones and for 99.9% availability over a given year
	- No operational overhead, no lifecycle charges, no retrieval charges, and no minimum storage duration
	
4. Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
	- Data retrieval in milliseconds with the same performance as S3 Standard
	- Designed for durability of 99.999999999% of objects across multiple Availability Zones
	- Designed for 99.9% data availability in a given year
	- 128 KB minimum object size
5. Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval (Formerly S3 Glacier)
	- Designed for durability of 99.999999999% of objects across multiple Availability Zones
	- S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval delivers low-cost storage, up to 10% lower cost (than S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval)
	- Archive data that is accessed 1—2 times per year
	- 99.99% availability

6. Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive
 	- Designed for durability of 99.999999999% of objects across multiple Availability Zones
	- Lowest cost storage class designed for long-term retention of data that will be retained for 7-10 years
	- Retrieval time within 12 hours

7. Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)
	- S3 One Zone-IA is for data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed.
	- Unlike other S3 Storage Classes which store data in a minimum of three Availability Zones (AZs), 
	- S3 One Zone-IA stores data in a single AZ and costs 20% less than S3 Standard-IA. 
	- Same low latency and high throughput performance of S3 Standard
	- Designed for durability of 99.999999999% of objects in a single Availability Zone†
	- Designed for 99.5% availability over a given year
